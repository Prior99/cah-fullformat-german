# Cards Against Humanity Fullformat German

This is a fork (or remake) of cards against humanity fully translated to german and changed to fit german culture and media.

Black cards are remade ink-friendly with a black stripe on the left side instead of being fully black.

## Building

This is totally written in LaTeX, you will need to install a LaTeX environement such as luatex or texlive in order to build this.

There is a Makefile included which will invoke ```pdflatex``` in order to build a pdf containing all cards.

The PDF contains card fronts on odd and the corresponding card backs on even pages.

## Categories

The cards were categorized so you can choose a fitting set of cards for each group of people to play with. The current categories are (German):

 + Basis
 * Böse
 * Drogen
 * Eklig
 * Geschichte
 * Kultur
 * FSK 16
 * FSK 18
 * Politik
 * Religion
 * Werbung
